Independent supramolecular nanocarriers can transport pairs of complementary reactants inside living cells in two consecutive incubation steps.  
After the second internalization step, the nonemissive reactants produce a fluorescent product with the concomitant appearance of intense fluorescence exclusively in the intracellular space.  
These results demonstrate that supramolecular delivery can be exploited to perform chemical reactions inside target cells and can lead to valuable strategies for the intracellular synthesis of drugs.

The incorporation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments along a common polymer backbone produces amphiphilic macromolecules capable of assembling spontaneously into supramolecular constructs in aqueous environments.1â€“7  Noncovalent contacts bring the hydrophobic domains of distinct macromolecular components together to prevent their direct exposure to the many surrounding water molecules.  Solvation of the hydrophilic counterparts maintains the resulting nanoscaled assemblies in solution and prevents their further association into microscaled aggregates.  The ultimate result is the formation of supramolecular nanostructures with hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic surface.
