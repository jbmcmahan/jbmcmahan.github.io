				<p class="align-justify">A fractured bone can cause limited mobility and range of motion to perform daily tasks. Bone fractures can affect anyone, though is more common to occur in younger children and elderly populations. The population’s desired outcome would be a more accessible method of efficient skeletal growth. In order to efficiently affect the patient need, the solution’s design must maintain bone support, utilize a bone growth stimulator, allow for clinician application, and incorporate a fracture site access point. The resultant concept consisted of a two part design: a casting device for fracture site access and a dosage monitor for LIPUS monitoring.</p>
