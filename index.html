							<p class="align-justify">One of the major professional goals in my life is to lead the development of a novel and affordable therapeutic with the ability to help a significant number of people. I plan on accomplishing this by eventually becoming a research scientist at a biopharmaceutical company, and pursuing a Ph.D. at Boston University will help prepare me for these goals. My passion is to work in a research lab that uses synthetic biology due to the fieldâ€™s demonstrated potential in revolutionizing pharmaceuticals. I am aiming to utilize the training I have received through both research and industry experience in a lab focused on applications of synthetic biology.</p>
